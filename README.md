# Heart Attack Prediction and Analysis System

## Technologies Used

### Python
- I used Python as the main programming language for my project.

### Jupyter Notebook
- I did my work in Jupyter Notebook, where I wrote and executed code and added explanations.

### Pandas
- I used Pandas for working with data:
  - Loading the heart attack dataset.
  - Identifying and managing duplicate rows.
  - Handling missing values.
  - Creating categories for certain numerical data.

### Numpy
- Numpy helped with numerical calculations behind the scenes.

### Seaborn
- I used Seaborn for creating visualizations:
  - Heatmaps for feature correlations.
  - Count plots for categorical feature distributions.
  - Box plots to identify outliers.

### Matplotlib
- Matplotlib was used to customize and enhance plots.

### Scipy
- Scipy was used for statistical functions and outlier detection.

### Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
- Scikit-Learn played a central role in my project:
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
  - Building machine learning models, including RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier.
  - Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics.
